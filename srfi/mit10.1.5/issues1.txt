Grabbed Adam Massmann's implementation of match after several attempts to use
r7rs style library definition.
Using his load file with match (modified for for vector matches like original)
gives:

$ rlwrap mit-scheme
MIT/GNU Scheme running under GNU/Linux
<cut 6 lines from banner>
  Release 10.1.5 || Microcode 15.3 || Runtime 15.7 || SF 4.41 || LIAR/x86-64 4.118

1 ]=> (load "load")

;Loading "load.scm"...
;  Loading "match.scm"... done
;... done
;Unspecified return value

1 ]=> (shinn-match '(1) (a #t))

;Unbound variable: sk
<cut 6 error/reset lines>

Tried Adam's module instead, but even after adding match to
(declare (usual-integrations))
[so (declare (usual-integrations match))]
got:

1 ]=> (load "load")

;Loading "load.scm"...
;  Loading "match.scm"...
;The object (opt (subform (cons (keep-if id=? else) (* any)))), passed as an argument to
 pattern->spar, is not a syntax-parser pattern.
