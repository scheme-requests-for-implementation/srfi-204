When I try to use the pattern matcher, foment crashes
Specifically, the matcher works as long as there are no
pattern variables, so:
(match 1 (1 #t))

(match 2 (1 #t)
         (2 #f))

(match '(1 2 2) ((1 2 ...) 2))

all return the expected value, but

(match '(1 2 2) ((a b ...) b))

crashes with "assert IdentifierP(obj) (190)../src/synrules.cpp"
and then a long column if hexcodes? instructions?

this issue remained after underscore? and r6rs compatibility changes,
deleted directory.
